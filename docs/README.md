## Project Overview

This project implements and compares three state-of-the-art inpainting methods on X-ray images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset:

- **AOT-GAN**: Attention-based Outpainting Transformer for Generative Adversarial Networks
- **ICT**: Image Completion Transformer
- **RePaint**: Repaint-based diffusion model for inpainting

## Key Features

- Platform-agnostic design for reproducibility
- Unified training and testing scripts
- Comprehensive evaluation framework
- Automated comparison and analysis tools
- Extensive documentation and tutorials

## Getting Help

- Check [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for common issues
